    "\n",
    "**The  deliverable for Part 1 of the project lab is OPTIONAL.**   However, the work for Part 2 depends on the work in Part 1, so it is to your advantage to do Part 1 and submit the interim deliverables.  If you choose to submit Part 1 by the deadline below we will grade it, return it to you with feedback so that you can use it for Part 2, improving /correcting it if needed/desired.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final grade for the Project Lab will be based on the Part 2 submission.  We will run any autograding tests performed in Part 1 on this submission plus additional tests for Part 2.   When you submit Part 2 you will include the functions written in Part 1, so if you previously submitted them your grade for these parts will be the same if you didn't change anything or different if you corrected any previous errors.   *The exception to this is if you turn in any part that is not your own work whether it is for the optional or final delivery you will receive zero for that part in the final grading e.g. if you turn in a Part 1 optional deliverable that uses AI/google/solution-other-than-your-own you will forfeit about half of the overall grade.*  \n",

    "Make sure to work steadily on the Project Lab starting in Week 13, even if you cannot make the optional deliverable.  Delaying starting it until the last minute / Week 14 is a bad idea and late submissions are not accepted. Aim to complete Part 1 by the deliverable date (end of Week 13) to ensure that you are on track to complete Part 2 on time. \n",

    "**Project Lab 2** examines a global earthquake record and is divided into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file for this lab contains earthquake data for earthquakes with magnitudes 4 or above ($M \\geq 4$) that have occurred globally in the 21st century, i.e. between `2000-01-01` and `2022-11-24`.\n",
    "Earthquake data for this lab were retrieved from **IRIS**: [&nearr; Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology](http://ds.iris.edu/ieb/index.html?format=text&nodata=404&starttime=1970-01-01&endtime=2025-01-01&minmag=0&maxmag=10&mindepth=0&maxdepth=900&orderby=time-desc&src=&limit=1000&maxlat=80.56&minlat=-80.56&maxlon=180.00&minlon=-180.00&zm=2&mt=ter). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1:** Do some basic exploratory data analysis of this data set to look at the overall properties of global seismicity (earthquakes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2:** Further explore some aspects of seismicity via qualitative observations of figures and quantitative modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the background reading (`project_lab2_background.ipynb`) BEFORE attempting the lab.  This contains information that will be applicable to different parts of the project lab (data files and formats, distances on a sphere etc).  In the project lab writeups we refer you back to sections in this reading where needed / appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to have gone over the notebook `pl2_pandas_getfamiliar.ipynb` which contains an overview of loading and manipulating a similar dataset to the one used in this project lab. Some of this may be repeated in a wk13 class notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Science Learning Goals: \n",
    "Implement and practice a robust approach for any data analysis problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conduct initial steps in exploratory data analysis: load data, parse, do some preliminary checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gain experience working with larger data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Practice initial data examination (maps, scatter plots) and decide on meaningful ways to subset your dataset(s) and examine them further. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make **qualitative observations** about the relationship of earthquakes and plate tectonic boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a **quantitative estimate** of the geometry of a subducting tectonic plate underneath South America using earthquake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python / Coding Learning Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Algorithm design and modularizing code:  Break down a problem into distinct pieces, most of which will be parsed into one or more re-usable functions: loading and parsing data sets, slicing, analyses (maps, stats, curve-fitting), outputs (figures/results).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pandas\n",
    "    - Load data into a `pandas` `DataFrame` and examine the basic properties of that `DataFrame`.\n",
    "    - Access `pandas` `Series` (columns) in the `DataFrame`.\n",
    "    - Extract individual series into distinct variables and manipulate these using familiar `numpy` tools.\n",
    "    - Slicing / subselecting, and writing to new `DataFrame` objects. \n",
