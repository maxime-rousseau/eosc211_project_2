In the file, latitudes and longitudes are in degrees, depths are in kilometers, magnitudes are unitless, and times are a string written in what is known as ISO format. The time strings contain `year-month-day`, then the letter `T` then time in `hr-min-sec`, e.g. \"2000-10-31T01:30:00.000-05:00\".\n",

    "To calculate distance, $d$, relative to a reference longitude, $\\phi_1$ along a line of constant latitude (in the week 4 lab this was relative to Vancouver) we need the difference between a given second longitude, $\\phi_2$, and the longitude of the reference point, $\\Delta \\phi =  (\\phi_2 - \\phi_1)$. The distance in units of length along the surface between $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ is then  $d = L_{\\phi} \\cdot  \\Delta\\phi$\n",
